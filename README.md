# WaterLevelControl-PID-TIA-FactoryIO

This repository showcases an industrial automation project focused on water level control using a PID control algorithm implemented with TIA Portal and Factory IO. The project aims to regulate the water level in a tank accurately and efficiently.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes the following components:
- TIA Portal: A powerful engineering software used for configuring, programming, and commissioning industrial automation systems.
- Factory IO: A virtual factory simulation software that enables the testing and visualization of automation projects.

## Functionality

The system is simulated in Factory IO, where a virtual level sensor senses the water level in the tank. The PID controller, implemented in TIA Portal, dynamically adjusts the flow rate of water into the tank to maintain the desired water level. The control system's performance is evaluated by measuring key parameters such as rise time, settling time, and overshoot of the water level response.

## Getting Started

To replicate and explore the project, follow these steps:
1. Install TIA Portal and Factory IO on your system.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/WaterLevelControl-PID-TIA-FactoryIO.git`
3. Configure the virtual environment in Factory IO using the provided configuration files.
4. Import and compile the PID control algorithm in TIA Portal.
5. Run the simulation and analyze the results.
